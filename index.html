        <h2>An explicit list of features </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Mutiple Ropes: I expanded the starter rope code to support
            multiple swinging ropes. There is also one way interaction with spheres
            and collision handling logic reused from the particle simulation demo.</li>
            <li>Cloth Simulation: Horizontal springs were added to the ropes
            to create the cloth. The video shows the cloth falling on the 
            sphere obstacle.</li>
            <li>3D Simulation: The cloth is rendered using Unity 3D. There is also 
            controls for the camera to change the view. arrow keys to move around
            and right click while dragging the mouse to look around. q and e keys to go
            up and down.</li>
            <li>High quality rendering - The rendering uses 3D lighting provided
            by Unity 3D. The cloth is textured with an image of the University of Minnesota logo.</li>
            <li>Challenge: Continuum Fluid simulation - The second video shows
            a visualization of the shallow water equation in 1D. It's expanded to a
            2D mesh colored blue to look like water. There is a border around
            the fluid to make it look like a tank of water. The rendering is also 
            done in Unity 3D.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>List of tools/libraries</h2>
        <p>This project I decided to try Unity 3D instead of processing. I found that the 
        Unity project was easier to debug and test which let me iterate on the project faster.
        The rope/cloth code was adapted from the rope example showed in class. The 1D 
        SWE equation is also based on the slides.</p>
        <h2>difficulties encountered</h2>
        <p>I didn't face any difficulties, never used unity before but it was easy to a 3d scene running and adapt the processing code. </p>
